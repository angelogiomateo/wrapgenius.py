# wrapgenius.py
Python wrapper for the Genius API / spiritual successor to my previous hacked-together project, [rapgenius.py](https://github.com/pconner03/rapgenius.py)

Probably abandonware

# Getting started
Can only do basic access right now. Create a wrapgenius\_secrets.py file with variable ACCESS\_TOKEN={your access token}

Uses Genius API search method (which searches for songs, but lists songs by an artist if you search for an artist)
